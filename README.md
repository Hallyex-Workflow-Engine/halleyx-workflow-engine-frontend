##  Project Setup

### Backend (Spring Initializer)

- Project: Maven
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: 3.x
- Dependencies:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - MySQL Driver
  - Lombok

Run backend:
mvn spring-boot:run

###  Frontend (React)

Create React app using Vite:

npm create vite@latest
cd project-name
npm install
npm run dev

Install dependencies:

npm install axios react-router-dom

##  Authentication

- Session-based authentication using JSESSIONID
- Role-based access:
  - ADMIN
  - USER (Manager / CEO approvals)

##  Workflow Overview

A workflow consists of:
- Multiple Steps
- Each step can be:
  - APPROVAL (manual)
  - SYSTEM (automatic)

Execution flow:
1. User starts workflow
2. Moves step-by-step
3. Approval steps wait for user action
4. Rules decide next step

##  Rule Engine (MVEL)

The system uses MVEL (Expression Language) to evaluate rules dynamically.

### Example Rules:
amount > 100 && priority == 'High' -> Finance Approval  
amount <= 100 -> CEO Approval  
true -> Task Rejection  

Rules are stored in DB and evaluated at runtime.
